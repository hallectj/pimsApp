# README

Ruby version 2.3.3
Rails version 5.1.6

This was a project our team of 4 developers were desginated to do for our capstone project at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.  

For future employers, I did most of the GUI design for just about everything you see since I have extensive experience in HTML / CSS and JavaScript.  Connecting devise and assigning roles to users was done by me, connecting the users with authentication using devise and roles was done by myself.  Dashboard for superuser was done by me using the cancancan gem and rails admin gem.  Hooking everything together so the database talks to the inputs was done by myself as well.  If you are interested in a live demo, you can go to https://pims-2018.herokuapp.com/ and mess around.  This is obviously a fictious app, but to see everything in action, the login credintials are below.  Obviously in real life, I wouldn't use such an easy password, but for demonstration purposes here they are.

Doctor
username: doctor@example.com
password: password

Medical personnel (ie a nurse)
username: medical@example.com
password: password

Office personnel 
username: office@example.com
password: password

Volunteer personnel
username: volunteer@example.com
password: password

The database used in postgres.  If you have any questions you can email me hallectj@gmail.com.  Be sure to look at my other projects here on Github.

Special note:  All features are ot fully implemented yet on Heroku, we are planning on doiing a massive update Friday afternoon or Friday Evening 11/16/2018, so if you see any errors, they will proably be resolved by then. 

Thank you and happy coding
